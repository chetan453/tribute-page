        <ul><li>Dr Kalam served as the 11th President of the country. Before that, in his aerospace scientist avatar, Kalam had worked for the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) â€” India's premier space research bodies.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><li>
            Kalam's role in the development of the Indian ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology was one of highlights of his storied career. During his days as a scientist, he played a major part in the Pokhran-II nuclear tests.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><li>
            After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><li>
            In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.[11][27] Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.

        <ul><li>
            Kalam served as the 11th President of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007.[38] <br>

            On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President,[39][40] and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy.[41][42] After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear.[43] Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature.
